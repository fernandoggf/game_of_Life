This is a basic approach to the development of the game of life. Coded in python. Its objective it is to learn one way to do it.

- gof_0_1.py _ is the main program behind the structure of the game, it has its grid, how was it thought and the code in python.
- gof_tk (should be .py) _ Is added the Tkinter lib which is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) packag.
- gof_tk.py _ is the join between the two above. While running, it displays a graphical output to see the process and the progress of the game

- The game has its initial values in the code that can be changed just in the begin.

- Later: add buttons to dictate the initial conditions once it has been run.
